GitHub/Forking/Cloning/Etc

You will be provided links to all of the repos in the course. You will need to fork and clone them to your computer. 
When you fork a repo, you are making a copy of the original code. Any changes you make to the forked repo will not be applied to the original code. 
This keeps the original starter code intact for the next student. Cloning the repo moves the repo code onto your computer. 
If the code is not on your computer, you will not be able to work with it.

Make sure you are signed into your GitHub account.
Go to the starter code repo and fork it.  https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/python-hello-world
    A. The original repo. Notice the Lauchcode rocket next to the name.
    B. The Fork button. Click this to create a fork. You should be redirected to your fork once you click this button.
